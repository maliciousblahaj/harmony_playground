## Roadmap for this project

### Long-term goals
Eventually i want to create a DAW with first-class support for just intonation and microtonality, empowering composition and experimentation with advanced harmony.
This goal is however very far away and therefore not very concrete, so in this file i'll write some more concrete smaller goals, maybe with some technical implementation details too, who knows.

### Short-term goals
* Overhaul the synthesizer engine and implement syncing of oscillators
* Turn global frequencies into the full concept of global variables, so they can be used for more, for instance in denominators of ratios
* Add a timeline for creating harmonic progressions
* Add a node-based system for synthesizing sound
* Add mathematical expressions/functions for simply defining relations in variables
* Create a way to visualize sound waves and frequency spectras (probably using plotters crate)
